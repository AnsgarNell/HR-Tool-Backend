This document describes the Human Resources (HR) Management System developed based on the
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/employee/en/[Employees Sample Database] provided by https://www.mysql.com/[MySQL].
footnote:[The development of the project is explained in the Medium Article]

== Introduction

The HR Management System development has been done as a request received by the Imaginary Company, which wants to
update their current MS-DOS based solution to a Web environment.

=== Functional Requirements

Based on the specifications received from the client, we have the following functional requirements:

[#privilege-levels]
==== Privilege Levels

The employees who have access to the database must belong to only and exclusively one of the following levels:

[#privilege-levels-levels]
.Privilege levels (in descending order)
. HR Manager (Manager)
. HR Senior Staff (Senior Staff)
. HR Staff (Staff)

Every level must have all the permissions from the lower levels.

[#view-information]
==== View Information

All the information stored in the database is accessible, except for the next restrictions:

* Managers' salaries: only allowed to Senior Staff or higher.

As detailed in the indications about the navigation, the system sitemap must follow the next diagram:

ifdef::env-github[image::/images/sitemap.png[Diagram classes]]
ifndef::env-github[]
[plantuml,images/sitemap,png]
....
artifact departments
artifact employees
artifact employee as "employee information"
departments <-right-> employees
employees <-right-> employee
departments <-right-> employee : manager information
....

[#change-information]
==== Change information

The only information that can be changed in the database are the salaries, and only Senior Staff
or higher levels are allowed to do it. Following restrictions apply:

* Managers' salaries: only the Manager level must be able to change this information.
