=== Model

The original database schema can be seen in <<#database-schema>>.

NOTE: For the development, the entities names are in *singular* form, in order to avoid confusion when using a single
instance or several. So, the Employees tables is mapped to the Employee class, and so on. The plural form has been
maintained for other components like repositories or controllers. The same strategy has been followed in the frontend
implementation.

Let's analyze each of the tables and it contents.

[#department]
==== Department

The *Department* entity maps the *departments* table.

.Department Schema

endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[plantuml,images/department-schema,png]
....
entity Department {
    * deptNo : String
    --
    * deptName : String(40)
    managers : Set<DepartmentManager>
}
....
endif::env-github[]

[#employee]
==== Employee

The *Employee* entity maps the *employees* table.

ifdef::env-github[]
.Employee Schema
image::/images/employee-schema.png[Employee Schema]
endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[plantuml,images/employee-schema,png]
....
entity Employee {
    * empNo : Integer
    --
    * birthDate : Date
    * firstName : String(14)
    * lastName : String(16)
    * gender : ENUM('M','F')
    * hireDate : Date
    managerOf : List<DepartmentManager>
    employeeOf : List<DepartmentEmployee>
    titles : List<Title>
    salaries : List<Salary>
}
....
endif::env-github[]

[#department-manager]
==== Department Manager

The *DepartmentManager* class implements the join table *dept_manager* between the table *departments* and its
current and past managers (table *employees*).

ifdef::env-github[]
.Department Manager Schema
image::/images/department-manager-schema.png[Department Manager Schema]
endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[plantuml,images/department-manager-schema,png]
....
entity DepartmentManager {
    * department : Department
    * employee : Employee
    --
    * fromDate : Date
    * toDate : Date
}
....
endif::env-github[]

[#department-employee]
==== Department Employee

The *DepartmentEmployee* class implements the join table *dept_emp* between the table *departments* and its
current and past employees (table *employees*).

ifdef::env-github[]
.Department Employee Schema
image::/images/department-employee-schema.png[Department Employee Schema]
endif::env-github[]
ifndef::env-github[]
[plantuml,images/department-employee-schema,png]

entity DepartmentEmployee {
    * department : Department
    * employee : Employee
